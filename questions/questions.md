*Question 1*:

Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd
help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts: Records Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers,
George

*Answer 1*:

Hello George,

Thanks a lot for contacting us. My name is Vlad, and I am more than happy to assist you today with the questions.

Let me share the high-level answers with you in the letter, and I will also leave a few useful links, in case you'd want
to make a deeper dive into the topics.

1. Records Indexing - Indexing is the process by which search engines organize information before a search to enable
   super-fast responses to queries. The best example of how it works is Google. Every time you search for something, it
   has this small label right above the results, saying something like: *About 12,300,000 results (0.40 seconds)*.
   Obviously, to be that fast and efficient Google needs to store the relevant information conveniently for search
   purposes. The process of organizing the information in this convenient way is called indexing.

   Talking about Algolia specifically, you can fine-tune the indexing criteria and data passed to the engine for better
   results. For more information about that, please consider reviewing
   the [indexing best practices](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/indexing/indexing-best-practices/) and
   the [managing indices](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-indices-and-apps/manage-indices/)
   articles.


2. Custom Ranking - it is a way to help the engine in return more relevant results. For instance, when user types in "
   iPhone", they are likely to expect to see the latest models first. Basically, this means that newer models are more "
   relevant" than the older ones.

   As a person who knows about your business much more than the Algolia team will ever do, you can use this powerful
   tool to create bespoke ranking rules. For more information about that, please see the following
   page: [Custom Ranking](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/must-do/custom-ranking/)

I hope that I answered your questions. If you have any other questions or would like to discuss these topics a little
bit more, do not hesitate to contact me. I am always happy to help.

Regards,
Vlad

*Question 2*:

Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design.
Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this
is inconvenient.

Regards,
Matt

Hello Matt,

There is absolutely nothing to be sorry about. The negative feedback is the most valuable one: It helps us to improve
and to make our product better for you, our customer. Thanks a lot for sharing it with us.

First things first, I shall pass this information to the production team. Although I cannot guarantee anything at this
stage, there is a chance that some improvements might be made in the next release.

Secondly, maybe some kind of workaround would work for you. For instance, using our API we can create a simple script,
that will do exactly what you need; or perhaps our services team could develop a bespoke admin page directly in your
solution?

Please, let me know if any of these "hotfix" options work for you, or if you have any other questions.

Regards,
Vlad

*Question 3*:

Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level
process look like?

Regards,
Leo

Hi Leo,

Nice to e-meet you!
Happy to hear you are considering Algolia for your solution. The question about the development work is quite broad and
highly depends on your needs. It would be my pleasure to organize quick Zoom catchup to discuss how Algolia can help
improve your customers' experience. Please let me know what time is convenient for you.

In the meanwhile, I would like to share some intro materials with you.
This [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3MXYm4m1OM) is a good starting point. Next, I'd recommend looking
through general Algolia starting guides
like [this one](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/).

Also, if you are more of a "hands-on" guy, like me, feel free to sign up for a free plan and try out the Algolia
yourself. The platform has comprehensive mock data sets and demo pages. The best part is that it does not require any
payment information or something like this. The whole sign-up process will take no more than 30 seconds.

Please, let me know if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Vlad
